# **Fun** Stuff for ElvUI (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do remember some of those April Fools jokes ElvUI had?**  

### Since the old jokes were removed and no longer available to the users. There has been people that want to run around with the Hello Kitty look or wanted to do "The Harlem Shake" with their toon and ui or even make their ui have the appearance of Tukui. So digging at past code and a lot of back and forth comparing old Tukui look and trying to mimic it in ElvUI, this plugin was created to make it pretty painless to use the missing goodies. This is pretty lightweight and doesn't contain any options that effect performance minus the dancing kittys which is very minimal (only because the animation code to loop them to make them dance).


**Many Thanks for original code or contributed in some way**
